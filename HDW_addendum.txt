This allows for a single country region tx power table for a regulatory area (e.g ETSI) instead of a separate table for each subjected country.


HDW_IGNORE_FW_COUNTRY_CODE:
==========================
The firmware reports an incorrect operating country code, ignore it.

HDW_US_TXPOWER_TABLES_BY_DEFAULT:

Load the US Tx power tables to provide default values while the regulatory domain is not set

Furthermore:
- Some convenience makefiles (pc-make and imx-make) has been added.
