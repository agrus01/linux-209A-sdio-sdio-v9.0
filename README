The install-driver.sh script will build the kernel drivers for WiFi and install the chip firmware.
Please note that the  script does NEITHER insert the driver modules into linux kernel NOR set them up for plug n play.
To insert the modules into linux kernel, please refer to load-driver.sh or wlan_src/README to get more information, 
for example supported linux kernel version and driver load parameters.

For the UART Bluetooth driver, the hci_uart driver from the mainline kernel tree can be used. To run Bluetooth, please refer to run-bt.sh script.

Please visit http;//support.hd-wireless.com for more guides to enabling the device features.
