SPB209A regulatory tables
=========================

Note: Please, read first the document 'Regulatory domains.pdf' to get an
understanding of what regulatory domains are and how they are enforced in
the Linux kernel.

To comply with the domains the SPB209A has been certified in, you need to add
the regulatory tables from this folder to your Linux distribution on your end
product. You can either:
- use the 'regulatory.bin' file with CRDA, in which case don't forget to also
install 'hdwireless-reg.key.pub.pem'
- use the 'db.txt' file for direct inclusion within the kernel
- use the 'regulatory.db' and 'regulatory.db.p7s' files if you want to load the
regulatory database as a firmware. To use this method, you will also need to
recompile your kernel with the 'hdwireless-reg.hex' certificate added to the
folder <kernel_src>/net/wireless/certs/
